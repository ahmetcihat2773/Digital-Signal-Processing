# Beamforming
In communication, beamforming is used to increase the quality of communication. On the other hand, beam forming also can be used to detect the direction of source signal.
The beamforming, i.e., spatial filtering, aims to suppress signals arriving from undesirable directions while amplifying signals from desired directions.

Beamforming is used deliver sufficient gain and sensitivity for radio observations while maintaining
control over beam pattern sidelobes and system noise.8
# Acoustics I - Noise Source Location
Acoustic beamforming is a technique to measure the sound pressure thanks to some microphones arrays and also that is able to locate the sound source, either meaningfull or noise by processing the collected sound signals. This technique involved in many acedemic and industrial applications. In daily life, sound noise is one of the main problem of the today world. Every produced vehicle, machines or any tools have to have a sound noise below some certain level according to some standarts. Detecting the noise source in a device is a challenging task for engineers. However beamforming is one of the most successful noise localization technique that allows engineers to distinguish each and individual noise sources.
Thanks to all development in technologhy, we are able to build robust microphone arrays that is equipped with more than a hundred of microphones which allows us to perform preciese noise source localization[Fundamentals of Acustic BeamformingXX.pdf]
